<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello my name is Skyler and I am a student currently enrolled at DMACC. I am working on a CS degree and my dream job is to work as a game developer.</p>

<h1>Why I wanted to learn programming</h1>
<p>Ever sense I was a little kid I have said that I would like to make my own video games. 
At the time I had no clue how video games where made or what programming was.<br>
As I grew up my intrest in video games continued and I started getting into other technology.
I started off by rooting my phones and just messing around with other tech and seeing what I could do.<br>
When I got to high school I took intro to html and when I saw what I was able to do It made me want to dive more into it.
So I started taking as many computer classes as I could because I wanted to see what else was out there and what was possible.
